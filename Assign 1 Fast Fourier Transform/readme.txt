a fft filter(not real time) was designed to rid human voice off microphone's noise
the first part of the py file gives the filter
the second part of the py file provide a word voice recognizer of "hello" using my colleague Rachel's recording. Yet it doesn't seem recognizing anyone else' voice,hahahaha!
