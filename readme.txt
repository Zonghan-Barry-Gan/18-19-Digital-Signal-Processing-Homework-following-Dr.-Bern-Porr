The work in this repository are the homework using python to realize digital signal processing, taught by Dr. Bern Porr, University of Glasgow, 2018-2019.
Dr.Bern's style of teaching is kind of inordinary, but extremely helpful if you take it real and put heart into it: The course work are oneline in youtube, while whole course time are used to provide advice for student to practise in assignment.
Such teaching style not only increase students' ability on problem based learning, but also teach student to feel and learn the coding phylosophy of Dr.Bern
This is probably one of the best CS cousre I've ever taked. It helps student go beyoud the knowledge of dsp! Don't be so worry about the negative comment, especially on difficulties. They are easy to overcome if you do your put your heart to make the content and the practice in this course tangible to yourself. 

With great respect, Devoted to Dr. Bern Porr.



PS: AS I'm busy doing my final project, some work in this respository may be lack of comment and thus hard to understand. I will soon add sufficient comment.
